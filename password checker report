🌟 Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords
Use a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
Make the password at least 12–16 characters long.
Avoid dictionary words, names, or keyboard patterns.
Do not reuse passwords across multiple sites.
Place symbols and numbers in the middle, not just at the end.
Avoid consecutive and repeated characters.
Use a passphrase if possible – a combination of unrelated words, numbers, and symbols.

🧠 Tips Learned from the Evaluation
Adding just one uppercase letter and a symbol improved the strength dramatically.
Using mixed character types and placing special characters in the middle increases complexity.
Passwords with no repeating/consecutive characters have higher scores.
The most secure password (P@5$W0rD!98) included multiple character types and avoided all common patterns.

🛡️ Common Password Attack Methods
Attack Type	Description
Brute Force	Attempts every possible character combination until the correct password is found. Time increases exponentially with length and complexity.
Dictionary Attack	Uses known wordlists (like "password", "admin123") to guess passwords. Fails if non-dictionary words or symbols are used.
Credential Stuffing	Uses leaked usernames and passwords from breaches on other sites.
Hybrid Attack	Combines dictionary and brute force (e.g., adding numbers to dictionary words).

🔒 Impact of Password Complexity on Security
High complexity increases the time and computational resources required to crack a password.
Low complexity (e.g., only lowercase letters or numbers) makes it easier for brute-force or dictionary attacks to succeed.
Mixed character types and random structure significantly increase resistance to attacks.
Tools and attackers prioritize simple patterns—avoiding those provides a crucial layer of defense.
🎯 Outcome
Gained hands-on experience in password evaluation and understood the key characteristics of strong passwords, common attack techniques, and the importance of complexity in protecting user credentials.
